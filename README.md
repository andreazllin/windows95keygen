## More Infos
[Here](https://github.com/nilaerdna/Windows95NT4KeyGenerator/blob/master/README.md)

I wanted to do something with Electron, but it didn't work, so it's just an HTML page. I had to rewrite the generator in JavaScript, nothing fancy, just rewrote the python code with the matching js functions.
## Inspiration
- [FlyTech's Video](https://youtu.be/3DCEeASKNDk) - ðŸŽ¥ Video about this topic.
- [Windows 95 UI Kit](https://github.com/themesberg/windows-95-ui-kit) - ðŸ’¾ Windows 95 UI Kit made with Bootstrap 4 components.

Ended up not using this last one, but while rewriting my own css I took inspiration from it.
