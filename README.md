I wanted to do something with Electron, but it didn't work out, so it's just an HTML page. I had to rewrite the generator in JavaScript from Python, nothing fancy, just rewrote the Python code with the matching JavaScript functions.

You can check out my Python version [[HERE]](https://github.com/nilaerdna/Windows95NT4KeyGenerator)

### Tested on:
- Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server (4.00.1381.1)
- Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation (4.00.1381.1) [OEM]
- Microsoft Windows 95C (4.03.1216.OSR2.5) [OEM]

### How does it work?
Check out [Medium's article](https://medium.com/@dgurney/so-you-want-to-generate-license-keys-for-old-microsoft-products-a355c8bf5408) about it.

## Inspiration/Credits
- [FlyTech's Video](https://youtu.be/3DCEeASKNDk) - ðŸŽ¥ Video about this topic.
- [Windows 95 UI Kit](https://github.com/themesberg/windows-95-ui-kit) - ðŸ’¾ Windows 95 UI Kit made with Bootstrap 4 components.

Ended up not using this last one, but while writing my own CSS I took inspiration from it.
