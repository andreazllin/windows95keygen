I wanted to do something with Electron, but it didn't work out, so it's just an HTML page. I had to rewrite the generator in JavaScript from Python, nothing fancy, just rewrote the Python code with the matching JavaScript functions.

## Updates

### 31/10/2020

I've updated it! Now it's also an API, you just need to make a GET request.

OEM Key `curl https://windows95keygen.tk/api/oem`

Normal Key `curl https://windows95keygen.tk/api/normal`

### 01/12/2020

I changed it from a Express.js API to a Next.js one.

It's now hosted on Vercel, the GUI version it's a little bit slow, it takes around 1s to get the response.

### 11/01/2021

It's a real Next/React app! Not just some HTML and vanilla JS pasted into it...

### 05/09/2021

You can now check/validate your keys!

You just need to send a GET request at `https://windows95keygen.tk/api/validate` with this format

```json
{ key: "YOUR KEY" }
```

## Inspiration/Credits

- [FlyTech's Video](https://youtu.be/3DCEeASKNDk) - ðŸŽ¥ Video about this topic.
- [Windows 95 UI Kit](https://github.com/themesberg/windows-95-ui-kit) - ðŸ’¾ Windows 95 UI Kit made with Bootstrap 4 components.

Ended up not using this last one, but while writing my own CSS I took inspiration from it.
